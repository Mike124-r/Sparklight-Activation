This article will show you how to activate your equipment, whether you do it yourself or have a professional do it for you.

What does it mean to activate Sparklight?
Activation is the process of signing up for your service and making sure it is completely connected to your Sparklight account so you can use it. Your equipment may be physically connected, but the service won't work until the system identifies and connects your hardware to your account.

What You Need to Start
To turn on your Sparklight service, you need to have the following information ready:

Your account number for Sparklight

Your service address and ZIP code

The serial number of the modem or cable box, which is normally on a sticker on the device

A gadget that can connect to the internet, like a smartphone, tablet, or computer

If you're using your own modem or router, be sure your equipment works with Sparklight's system.

How to Turn on Sparklight Internet Service
If you want to put up your own equipment, Sparklight has self-installation kits available. If you get one of these kits, do the following:

Step 1: Plug in your modem
The coaxial wire from the wall outlet should be plugged into the modem.

Connect the power adapter and wait for the modem lights to come on.

Use an Ethernet cable to connect your computer to the modem, or wait until after activation to connect via Wi-Fi.

Step 2: Visit the page for activation
Open a web browser on your device that can connect to the internet.

You might be sent to Sparklight's activation page without having to do anything.

If not, type in the activation address that came with your welcome materials.

Step 3: Fill in your account information
Fill in your account number, ZIP code, and any other relevant information.

To finish the process, follow the directions on the screen.

If it works, the modem will restart and connect you to the internet.

How to Turn on Sparklight Cable TV
If your Sparklight plan comes with cable TV, you will need to set up and turn on your cable box or receiver.

Step 1: Get the cable box ready
Connect the coaxial line from the wall to the box.

Connect the box to your TV with an HDMI cable.

Connect the power adapter and turn on the television.

Change the TV's input or source to the right HDMI port.

Step 2: Do what the screen says to do
You might see a screen that says "Welcome" or "Setup." To set up the cable box, follow these steps.

If asked, use a computer or smartphone to navigate to the activation page online.

To connect the box to your account, type in your account number, ZIP code, and the serial number of your device.

Your box will start downloading channel information as soon as it is turned on. Your TV service should be ready soon.

How to Turn on Sparklight Phone Service
If you have Sparklight's digital phone service:

Step 1: Hook up the phone
Connect a regular phone to the "TEL 1" port on the back of your modem or gateway.

Check to see that your modem is fully connected and turned on.

Step 2: Look for a dial tone
After you've set it up, pick up the phone to see if it rings.

If you don't hear a dial tone, restart the modem and wait for the phone indicator to stop blinking.

Once your internet service is confirmed, phone service activation normally happens on its own. For number porting, activation may take longer and need to be coordinated with customer care.

Common Problems with Activation and How to Fix Them
1. The modem won't connect
Make sure all the cables are tight.

Try a different coaxial port.

Make sure your modem is on Sparklight's list of permitted devices.

2. The activation page isn't loading
Turn off and on your device and modem.

Try a different web browser.

Try a private or incognito window or clear your browser's cache.

3. TV Service Not Showing Channels
Give it a few minutes to start up.

Set your TV's input to the right HDMI source.

If you can't see any channels, unplug the cable box and plug it back in.

4. Phone Doesn't Have a Dial Tone
Make sure your phone is plugged in correctly.

Restart the modem.

Make that the TEL light on the modem is on and not blinking.
